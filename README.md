## Automatic Stack Overflow links

This repository has a feature that automatically suggests
relevant Stack Overflow posts when a new issue is created.
Using OpenAI's ChatGPT and the Stack Exchange API, we
generate a list of relevant posts based on the issue text
and title and add a comment with links to those posts.
This feature helps developers quickly find relevant
resources and documentation that can help them solve the
issue at hand.
